# PHASE 5 — Readiness Authorization

**Program:** VietSalePro v7 — System Recovery Program  
**Document Type:** Governance Transition Authorization  
**Authorization Date:** 2026-07-17  
**Authority:** Program Governance Transition Review  
**Verdict:** **B. NOT READY FOR PHASE 5**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document is the formal governance transition review between Phase 4 and Phase 5 of the VietSalePro v7 System Recovery Program. It does not plan, design, or initiate Phase 5 work. It only evaluates whether starting Phase 5 today would violate existing governance.

---

## 2. Documents Reviewed (in prescribed order)

| # | Document | Role in Review | Key Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `SYSTEM_RECOVERY_MASTER_PLAN.md` | Defines Phase 4 / Phase 5 entry-exit criteria and phase dependencies. | Phase 4 blocks Phase 5; Phase 5 entry requires Phase 3 and Phase 4 exit criteria satisfied, plus accepted canonical chain, RPC contract, and test/audit gates. |
| 2 | `CURRENT_PHASE.md` | Operational phase marker. | Still declares **Phase 4 Active** and explicitly prohibits Phase 5 start. |
| 3 | `PHASE4_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md` | Formal Phase 4 acceptance. | Status: **Accepted**, 2026-07-17; all deliverables and exit criteria PASS. |
| 4 | `PHASE4_FINAL_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md` | Independent final audit. | Verdict: Phase 4 complete with observations; 184/184 service-layer RPC coverage; all gates pass. |
| 5 | `PHASE4_OBSERVATION_001_VALIDATION.md` | Independent validation of residual observation. | Observation #001 (`activate_pending_memberships`) classified as **Case B — outside Phase 4 scope**; not a Phase 4 blocker. |
| 6 | `PHASE4_FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md` | Final governance certification. | Verdict: **A. Phase 4 Complete**; residual observations removed from blocker list. |

## 3. Required Confirmations

| # | Confirmation | Status | Evidence / Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phase 4 is closed. | **PASS** | `PHASE4_FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md` verdict A. Phase 4 Complete; `PHASE4_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md` Status: Accepted. |
| 2 | All Phase 4 deliverables passed. | **PASS** | D-P4-01 to D-P4-04 all **Accepted** in `PHASE4_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md` §4. |
| 3 | All Phase 4 exit criteria passed. | **PASS** | EC-1 to EC-4 all **PASS** in `PHASE4_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md` §5 and `PHASE4_FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md` §4.1. |
| 4 | Recovery Program is completely ended. | **PASS** | Recovery Wave-05 formally accepted; `PHASE4_PROGRAM_STATUS_REVIEW.md` and `PHASE4_CLOSEOUT_REVIEW.md` confirm no Recovery Wave remains open. |
| 5 | No open `CURRENT_TASK` remains. | **FAIL** | `CURRENT_TASK.md` (Task ID SRP-P2-T005, Phase 2) is still **Status: Proposed — Pending Program Manager Approval**. It has never been closed or superseded. |
| 6 | No open Recovery Wave remains. | **PASS** | Only Recovery Waves 02–05 exist; Wave-05 is the final wave and is formally accepted. |
| 7 | No Phase 4 governance blocker remains. | **FAIL** | Multiple transition blockers remain: `CURRENT_PHASE.md` still forbids Phase 5 start; `CURRENT_TASK.md` is open; `UNIFIED_PROGRAM_STATE.md` still declares Phase 1 active; Phase 4 acceptance/certification documents and Phase 4 code changes are uncommitted. |

## 4. Phase 5 Readiness Assessment

### 4.1 Phase 5 Entry Criteria (source: `SYSTEM_RECOVERY_MASTER_PLAN.md` §4 Phase 5)

| # | Entry Criterion | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| EC-1 | Phase 3 and Phase 4 exit criteria are satisfied. | **Satisfied** — both phases formally accepted and certified. |
| EC-2 | Canonical migration chain, reconciled RPC contract, and validated test/audit gates are accepted. | **Satisfied** — evidenced by Phase 3 and Phase 4 acceptance records. |
| EC-3 | Inventory of documentation / governance contradictions from SCAR Phase 4 is available. | **Satisfied** — `PHASE4_RECOVERY_MAPPING_VALIDATION.md`, `PROGRAM_RECOVERY_AUTHORIZATION_ERRATA.md`, and `SCAR_PHASE4_REPORT.md` are available. |

### 4.2 Governance Transition Blockers

Despite Phase 4 certification, **starting Phase 5 today would violate governance** for the following reasons:

1. **Open `CURRENT_TASK`** — `CURRENT_TASK.md` (SRP-P2-T005) is still in `Proposed` status. The program hierarchy (Program → Phase → Milestone → `CURRENT_TASK` → Implementation) requires all operational work orders to be closed before a clean phase transition. Leaving an open `CURRENT_TASK.md` while opening a new phase is a governance violation.

2. **`CURRENT_PHASE.md` still prohibits Phase 5** — Section 9 of `CURRENT_PHASE.md` states: *"No Phase 5 activities may begin until Phase 4 exit criteria are met and formal acceptance is recorded in `PHASE4_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md`."* Although the acceptance record exists and is accepted, the phase marker itself has not been updated to close Phase 4 or authorize Phase 5. Starting Phase 5 without updating the operational phase marker violates the phase governance model.

3. **`UNIFIED_PROGRAM_STATE.md` is stale** — The unified program state still declares **Phase 1** as the active phase. This contradicts `CURRENT_PHASE.md` (Phase 4 active) and the certified reality (Phase 4 complete). The existence of contradictory official program-state documents is a governance blocker.

4. **Phase 4 artifacts and code changes are uncommitted** — `git status` shows `PHASE4_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md`, `PHASE4_FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md`, `CURRENT_PHASE.md`, `CURRENT_TASK.md`, and other Phase 4 governance documents are untracked; `scripts/audit-rpc-contracts.ts` and `tests/mocks/supabase.ts` are modified but uncommitted. The canonical repository history does not yet reflect Phase 4 completion or the fixes that produced the 184/184 coverage. Transitioning to Phase 5 on an uncommitted working-tree state is a configuration-management and governance risk.

---

## 5. Conclusion

**B. NOT READY FOR PHASE 5**

Phase 4 is certified complete, all Phase 4 exit criteria and deliverables are accepted, and the Recovery Program is closed. However, the governance transition to Phase 5 is **not clean**. The open `CURRENT_TASK.md`, the stale `CURRENT_PHASE.md` / `UNIFIED_PROGRAM_STATE.md`, and the uncommitted Phase 4 artifacts mean that beginning Phase 5 today would violate program governance.

---

## 6. Required Actions Before Phase 5 Can Begin

Before a Phase 5 Readiness Authorization can be issued as **A. READY FOR PHASE 5**, the following must be completed:

1. **Close or archive `CURRENT_TASK.md`** (SRP-P2-T005) by updating its status to `Closed` / `Accepted` or by formally superseding it.
2. **Update `CURRENT_PHASE.md`** to reflect that Phase 4 is closed and that Phase 5 entry is authorized, or create a Phase 5 operational marker consistent with the Master Plan.
3. **Reconcile `UNIFIED_PROGRAM_STATE.md`** so it no longer declares Phase 1 active and accurately records Phase 4 as complete.
4. **Commit the Phase 4 acceptance/certification documents and the Phase 4 implementation changes** (`scripts/audit-rpc-contracts.ts`, `tests/mocks/supabase.ts`, and any other Phase 4 changes) so the canonical repository state reflects Phase 4 completion.
5. **Re-run the Phase 5 readiness authorization** after the above transition hygiene items are resolved.
