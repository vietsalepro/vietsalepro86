```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Background

The previous enterprise review program has been completed successfully.

The following documents are **APPROVED** and are now the permanent
**System Source of Truth (SSOT)** for the Admin Dashboard:

``` text
01_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_ARCHITECTURE_MODEL.md
↓
02_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md
↓
03_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_EXECUTION_MODEL.md
↓
04_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_INVESTIGATION_PLAN.md
↓
05_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FORENSIC_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md
↓
06_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FORENSIC_INVESTIGATION.md
↓
07_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md
↓
08_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FINAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md
```

These documents define the approved Architecture, Dependency, Execution
Model, Investigation Methodology, Root Cause Analysis and Enterprise
Recommendations.

No future investigation or implementation may contradict these documents
unless they are formally revised.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Program Purpose

The objective of this program is **NOT** to redesign the Admin
Dashboard.

The objective is to use the approved SSOT to discover every remaining
inconsistency that exists in the current repository.

The investigation must compare the implementation against the approved
models and identify all remaining defects before any implementation work
begins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Program Mission

The program is divided into two major phases.

## Phase A --- Complete System Investigation

Objective:

-   Read the entire Admin Dashboard implementation.
-   Compare every implementation against the approved SSOT.
-   Discover every remaining inconsistency.

Repository scope includes:

-   React UI
-   Context
-   Hooks
-   Services
-   Business Logic
-   Database Schema
-   Supabase Migrations
-   RPC
-   Edge Functions
-   RLS
-   Triggers
-   Storage
-   Environment Configuration
-   Runtime Execution Flow

Deliverable:

``` text
ADMIN_DASHBOARD_SYSTEM_INCONSISTENCY_REPORT.md
```

Rules:

-   No code changes.
-   No migration changes.
-   No Edge Function changes.
-   No database changes.
-   No implementation.
-   Investigation only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase B --- System Remediation

This phase starts only after the investigation report has been
independently reviewed and approved, Phase A has been formally closed,
the baseline has been sealed, and the Phase B Opening Authorization
document has been approved.

Phase B Lifecycle:

``` text
Phase B Opening Authorization
        ↓
Remediation Master Plan
        ↓
Program Owner Decision Record
        ↓
Wave Authorization
        ↓

Wave Verification
        ↓
Wave Acceptance
        ↓
Wave Deployment Synchronization
        ↓
Wave Closeout
        ↓
Program Certification
```

The Program Owner Decision Record consists of the mandatory governance
decisions that gate Wave Planning and Engineering Kickoff. It is not
an implementation activity.

Phase B shall officially begin only after the Phase B Opening
Authorization document has been approved.

The Remediation Master Plan shall not be created before Phase B has
been formally opened.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. System Source of Truth (SSOT)

The following documents are the only approved architectural baseline:

-   01_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_ARCHITECTURE_MODEL.md
-   02_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md
-   03_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_EXECUTION_MODEL.md
-   04_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_INVESTIGATION_PLAN.md
-   05_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FORENSIC_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md
-   06_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FORENSIC_INVESTIGATION.md
-   07_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md
-   08_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FINAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md

Every observation must be verified against these documents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Investigation Principles

The investigation shall:

-   Never assume.
-   Always collect repository evidence.
-   Always provide traceability.
-   Compare implementation against SSOT.
-   Identify architectural inconsistencies.
-   Identify dependency inconsistencies.
-   Identify execution inconsistencies.
-   Identify business logic inconsistencies.
-   Identify database inconsistencies.
-   Identify migration inconsistencies.
-   Identify RPC inconsistencies.
-   Identify Edge Function inconsistencies.
-   Identify service inconsistencies.
-   Identify UI inconsistencies.

Every issue shall include:

-   Issue ID
-   Evidence
-   Impact
-   Severity
-   Confidence
-   Affected Artifacts
-   Root Cause Candidate

No remediation is allowed during this phase.

The Admin Dashboard shall ultimately achieve full consistency across:

-   Architecture
-   Dependency
-   Runtime Execution
-   Business Logic
-   Database
-   Migrations
-   RPC
-   Edge Functions
-   Services

```

Wave-03 established the Repository Hygiene governance model.

Repository Baseline Classification is now part of the permanent governance framework.

AI Development Infrastructure has been formally recognized.

These are governance milestones rather than implementation milestones.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 11. Program Transition Rules

Phase B SHALL NOT begin until ALL of the following are complete:

-   Investigation completed
-   Acceptance Review completed
-   Acceptance Conditions implemented
-   Phase A formally closed
-   Baseline officially sealed
-   Phase B Opening Authorization document approved

No remediation activity may begin before these conditions are satisfied.

Phase B shall officially begin only after the Phase B Opening
Authorization document has been approved.

The Remediation Master Plan shall not be created before Phase B has
been formally opened.

Wave Authorization SHALL NOT begin until the mandatory Program Owner
Decisions required by the Phase B governance model have been formally
recorded.

Engineering Kickoff SHALL NOT begin until:

-   Program Owner Decisions are completed.
-   Wave Authorization has been approved.
-   All governance gates have passed.

Wave Implementation SHALL NOT begin until:

-   Engineering Kickoff has been completed.
-   Wave Implementation Readiness Review has been completed.
-   Implementation has been formally authorized.

Remediation Master Plan is a strategic planning document. It SHALL NOT
perform:

-   Wave Planning
-   Wave sizing
-   Engineering authorization
-   Implementation authorization

Wave Deployment Synchronization SHALL NOT begin until Wave Acceptance
has been completed and the accepted repository revision has been frozen.

Wave Closeout SHALL NOT begin until Wave Deployment Synchronization
has been completed and the deployment evidence confirms synchronization
across Repository, Supabase Database, RPC, Edge Functions, Environment
Configuration, Vercel Deployment, and Runtime Behaviour.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 11A. Wave Deployment Synchronization Gate

Wave Deployment Synchronization is a mandatory governance gate between
Wave Acceptance and Wave Closeout.

**Purpose**

Ensure that the accepted repository revision is fully synchronized with
the deployed runtime environment before a wave is closed and its changes
are considered operational.

**Objectives**

-   Confirm that every accepted repository artifact is present in the
    target deployment environment.
-   Verify that database objects, RPCs, Edge Functions, environment
    configuration, and the deployed application revision match the
    accepted source.
-   Prevent acceptance from being treated as production-ready before
    runtime behavior is consistent with the committed source.

**Entry Criteria**

-   Wave Acceptance has been completed.
-   The accepted repository revision is frozen and tagged.
-   The target deployment environment has been identified in the Wave
    Authorization or a subsequent deployment instruction.
-   Deployment credentials and access are available and authorized.

**Exit Criteria**

-   Synchronization has been attempted for every artifact class required
    by the wave scope.
-   Evidence confirms that Repository, Supabase Database, RPC, Edge
    Functions, Environment Configuration, Vercel Deployment, and Runtime
    Behaviour match the accepted revision or that all remaining
    deviations are explicitly recorded as observations.
-   The Deployment Synchronization Report is completed and approved by
    the Enterprise Release Manager or PMO.

**Deliverables**

-   Wave Deployment Synchronization Report.
-   Environment comparison evidence.
-   Deployment logs and verification records.

**Evidence Required**

-   Repository revision identifier and diff against the accepted wave.
-   Supabase migration status and applied migration list.
-   RPC and Edge Function inventory with configuration (for example
    `verify_jwt`).
-   Vercel deployment revision and environment variables.
-   Runtime behaviour checks or logs that confirm the deployed system
    executes the accepted source.

**Relationship with Verification**

Verification confirms that the repository source satisfies the wave
scope and acceptance criteria. Deployment Synchronization confirms that
the same source is present in the target environment.

**Relationship with Acceptance**

Acceptance is the decision that the source changes are correct.
Deployment Synchronization is the operational confirmation that the
accepted source is deployed. Acceptance does not require deployment to
be complete; Closeout does.

**Relationship with Closeout**

Wave Closeout may begin only after Wave Deployment Synchronization is
complete. The synchronization evidence becomes part of the wave closeout
package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 12. Program Principles

The following governance principles are permanent:

-   Repository search alone shall never be considered sufficient evidence for dead-code identification.
-   Production verification is mandatory before removing any repository artifact.
-   Repository Hygiene requires evidence, not assumptions.
-   AI development infrastructure shall be treated as a separate repository class.
-   Governance documents are first-class project deliverables.
-   Historical governance records are part of enterprise traceability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 13. Repository Classification Policy

## Repository Baseline Classification

All repository artifacts shall be classified into one of the following categories:

-   **Application Source Code** — Runtime logic, UI, services, database artifacts, and deployment files required by the production system. Governance responsibility: engineering change control.
-   **Governance Documentation** — Charters, plans, reviews, authorizations, and decision records. Governance responsibility: enterprise decision chain; revisions require formal approval.
-   **AI Development Infrastructure** — Files generated and maintained by AI tooling to support repository understanding and agent navigation. Governance responsibility: AI tooling governance.
-   **Scratch / Working Artifacts** — Temporary notes, drafts, or exploratory outputs that are not approved deliverables. Governance responsibility: explicit review and disposition.
-   **Historical Governance Records** — Superseded or archived governance documents retained for enterprise traceability. Governance responsibility: preserve read-only and do not delete.

Future engineering work shall classify repository artifacts before proposing their removal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 14. Repository Decision Hierarchy

Repository disposition decisions shall always follow the following evidence hierarchy:

``` text
Highest priority

Production Behaviour
        ↓
Approved Architecture (SSOT)
        ↓
Governance Evidence
        ↓
Repository Evidence
        ↓
Repository Appearance
```

-   Repository appearance alone shall never override higher-order evidence.
-   Repository search results alone shall never justify deletion.
-   Every repository disposition decision shall identify the highest level of evidence supporting the decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 15. AI Development Infrastructure Policy

## `.codebase-memory`

The `.codebase-memory` directory is intentionally maintained as AI Development Infrastructure.

**Purpose**

The Knowledge Graph generated by the Codebase Memory MCP supports semantic repository understanding by AI Agents.

**Production Impact**

None.

**Engineering Impact**

-   Not application code.
-   Not a deployment artifact.
-   Not dead code.

**Versioning**

Versioning follows AI tooling governance.

Future engineers shall not remove or classify these files as obsolete solely because they are regenerated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 16. Knowledge Preservation Policy

Every completed Wave shall evaluate whether new permanent knowledge has been created.

Permanent knowledge includes:

-   architecture
-   repository policy
-   engineering methodology
-   AI tooling
-   governance process
-   operational policy
-   repository classification

When permanent knowledge is created, the following documents shall be reviewed:

-   Program Charter
-   Master Plan
-   Roadmap
-   Knowledge Base

or equivalent governance documents.

Knowledge Preservation is an official governance deliverable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 17. Repository Hygiene Methodology

Repository Hygiene is the controlled process for identifying, evaluating, and removing or preserving repository artifacts. The methodology explicitly requires:

1.  Problem Identification
2.  Evidence Collection
3.  Production Verification
4.  Dependency Verification
5.  Architectural Verification
6.  Governance Review
7.  Disposition Decision
8.  Independent Verification
9.  Acceptance
10. Knowledge Preservation

Repository Hygiene is complete only after Knowledge Preservation has been performed.

Repository cleanup shall always follow this sequence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 18. Repository Knowledge Lifecycle

Repository knowledge evolves through the following lifecycle:

``` text
Repository Observation
        ↓
Investigation
        ↓
Evidence
        ↓
Governance Decision
        ↓
Implementation
        ↓
Verification
        ↓
Acceptance
        ↓
Knowledge Preservation
        ↓
Permanent Governance
```

Repository knowledge evolves through this lifecycle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 19. Production Infrastructure Policy

The following permanent governance rule applies to infrastructure artifacts:

-   Infrastructure artifacts must be verified in production before removal.
-   Repository presence alone does not determine operational usage.
-   Operational ownership must be identified before disposition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 20. Governance Feedback Loop

Every completed governance activity shall improve the governance system itself whenever justified by evidence.

The governance framework is therefore self-improving.

Future Waves inherit all validated governance improvements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 21. Governance Traceability Levels

Each engineering decision should be traceable through the following chain:

``` text
Program Charter
        ↓
Master Plan
        ↓
Wave Authorization
        ↓
Engineering Kickoff
        ↓
Implementation
        ↓
Verification
        ↓
Acceptance
        ↓
Deployment Synchronization
        ↓
Closeout
        ↓
Knowledge Preservation
```

This is the mandatory governance chain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 22. AI Agent Governance

Future AI Agents shall:

-   understand repository classifications before proposing changes
-   consult governance documents before deleting repository artifacts
-   treat AI Development Infrastructure separately from application code
-   preserve historical governance records
-   update governance documents whenever permanent project knowledge changes

AI Agents are expected to preserve organizational knowledge, not merely modify source code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 23. Governance Deliverables Policy

Governance artifacts are official project outputs. Examples include:

-   AUTHORIZATION
-   ENGINEERING KICKOFF
-   IMPLEMENTATION READINESS REVIEW
-   IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
-   VERIFICATION
-   ACCEPTANCE REVIEW
-   PROGRAM STATUS REVIEW
-   EXECUTION REPORT

## Governance Deliverable Classification

Governance deliverables are classified into the following categories:

### Strategic Governance

-   Program Charter
-   Master Plan
-   Roadmap

Strategic governance documents establish the constitutional, architectural, and directional foundations of the program. They provide the authority and long-term context for all engineering and governance activities.

### Operational Governance

-   Authorization
-   Engineering Kickoff
-   Implementation Review
-   Verification
-   Acceptance
-   Closeout

Operational governance documents authorize, record, and validate the execution of program work. They form the evidence chain that every Wave and package has been properly governed.

### Historical Governance

-   Closed Reviews
-   Historical Decisions
-   Archived Reports

Historical governance documents preserve the decision context of completed activities. They provide enterprise traceability and protect against repeated mistakes or disputed decisions.

These documents preserve the enterprise decision chain.

They are not temporary documentation.

They are part of the project's permanent governance evidence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 24. Lessons Learned

The evolution of the program has produced the following permanent lessons:

-   Repository structure evolves over time.
-   AI tooling must be governed explicitly.
-   Enterprise governance prevents accidental production regressions.
-   Architectural decisions must be preserved beyond implementation.
-   Future AI Agents should understand repository semantics rather than relying only on repository searches.
-   Repository semantics are more important than repository appearance.
-   Governance maturity increases after every completed Wave.
-   AI tooling requires governance just like production software.
-   Knowledge preservation reduces future engineering risk.
-   Enterprise memory is a strategic asset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 25. Final Governance Statement

The Program Charter is the constitutional governance document for the Admin Dashboard System Remediation Program.

Its purpose is not only to authorize work, but also to preserve the engineering methodology, organizational knowledge, architectural rationale, and governance evolution throughout the lifetime of the project.

Future governance documents derive from this Charter.

Future AI Agents and engineers are expected to follow its principles before performing investigation, implementation, repository cleanup, or architectural modification.
