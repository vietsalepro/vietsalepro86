# 2. Background

The previous enterprise review program has been completed successfully.

The following documents are **APPROVED** and are now the permanent
**System Source of Truth (SSOT)** for the Admin Dashboard:

``` text
01_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_ARCHITECTURE_MODEL.md
↓
02_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md
↓
03_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_EXECUTION_MODEL.md
↓
04_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_INVESTIGATION_PLAN.md
↓
05_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FORENSIC_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md
↓
06_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FORENSIC_INVESTIGATION.md
↓
07_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md
↓
08_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FINAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md
```

These documents define the approved Architecture, Dependency, Execution
Model, Investigation Methodology, Root Cause Analysis and Enterprise
Recommendations.

No future investigation or implementation may contradict these documents
unless they are formally revised.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Program Purpose

The objective of this program is **NOT** to redesign the Admin
Dashboard.

The objective is to use the approved SSOT to discover every remaining
inconsistency that exists in the current repository.

The investigation must compare the implementation against the approved
models and identify all remaining defects before any implementation work
begins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Program Mission

The program is divided into two major phases.

## Phase A --- Complete System Investigation

Objective:

-   Read the entire Admin Dashboard implementation.
-   Compare every implementation against the approved SSOT.
-   Discover every remaining inconsistency.

Repository scope includes:

-   React UI
-   Context
-   Hooks
-   Services
-   Business Logic
-   Database Schema
-   Supabase Migrations
-   RPC
-   Edge Functions
-   RLS
-   Triggers
-   Storage
-   Environment Configuration
-   Runtime Execution Flow

Deliverable:

``` text
ADMIN_DASHBOARD_SYSTEM_INCONSISTENCY_REPORT.md
```

Rules:

-   No code changes.
-   No migration changes.
-   No Edge Function changes.
-   No database changes.
-   No implementation.
-   Investigation only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase B --- System Remediation

This phase starts only after the investigation report has been
independently reviewed and approved, Phase A has been formally closed,
the baseline has been sealed, and the Phase B Opening Authorization
document has been approved.

Phase B Lifecycle:

``` text
Phase B Opening Authorization
        ↓
Remediation Master Plan
        ↓
Program Owner Decision Record
        ↓
Wave Authorization
        ↓
Engineering Kickoff
        ↓
Implementation Readiness Review
        ↓
Wave Implementation
        ↓
Wave Verification
        ↓
Wave Acceptance
        ↓
Program Certification
```

The Program Owner Decision Record consists of the mandatory governance
decisions that gate Wave Planning and Engineering Kickoff. It is not
an implementation activity.

Phase B shall officially begin only after the Phase B Opening
Authorization document has been approved.

The Remediation Master Plan shall not be created before Phase B has
been formally opened.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. System Source of Truth (SSOT)

The following documents are the only approved architectural baseline:

-   01_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_ARCHITECTURE_MODEL.md
-   02_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md
-   03_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_EXECUTION_MODEL.md
-   04_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_INVESTIGATION_PLAN.md
-   05_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FORENSIC_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md
-   06_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FORENSIC_INVESTIGATION.md
-   07_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md
-   08_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_FINAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md

Every observation must be verified against these documents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Investigation Principles

The investigation shall:

-   Never assume.
-   Always collect repository evidence.
-   Always provide traceability.
-   Compare implementation against SSOT.
-   Identify architectural inconsistencies.
-   Identify dependency inconsistencies.
-   Identify execution inconsistencies.
-   Identify business logic inconsistencies.
-   Identify database inconsistencies.
-   Identify migration inconsistencies.
-   Identify RPC inconsistencies.
-   Identify Edge Function inconsistencies.
-   Identify service inconsistencies.
-   Identify UI inconsistencies.

Every issue shall include:

-   Issue ID
-   Evidence
-   Impact
-   Severity
-   Confidence
-   Affected Artifacts
-   Root Cause Candidate

No remediation is allowed during this phase.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Final Objective

The Admin Dashboard shall ultimately achieve full consistency across:

-   Architecture
-   Dependency
-   Runtime Execution
-   Business Logic
-   Database
-   Migrations
-   RPC
-   Edge Functions
-   Services
-   UI
-   Operational Behavior

The target is to eliminate all confirmed inconsistencies before
implementation is declared complete.
